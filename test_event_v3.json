For an amplifier circuit, I would start by analyzing the requirements - gain, bandwidth, input/output impedance. Then I'd select appropriate components based on these specifications. The design process includes: 1) Choosing the right transistor or op-amp for the application, 2) Calculating biasing resistors to set the operating point, 3) Determining coupling capacitors for AC signals, 4) Adding bypass capacitors for stability. I would use simulation tools to verify the design before prototyping. The key is ensuring the circuit operates in the linear region and meets all performance criteria.\"},{\"question_id\": \"q2\",\"question\": \"Describe a challenging technical problem you've solved and your approach to finding the solution.\",\"answer\": \"I once had to debug a complex timing issue in a microcontroller system where interrupts were interfering with each other. My approach was systematic: first, I documented the exact symptoms and timing of the failures. Then I created a simplified test case to isolate the problem. I used oscilloscope measurements to verify the timing relationships and discovered that interrupt priorities weren't set correctly. The solution involved restructuring the interrupt handling to use proper priority levels and adding debouncing logic. I learned the importance of methodical debugging and the value of creating reproducible test cases.\"}],\"participant_name\": \"John Smith\",\"instance_id\": \"test_instance_123\",\"field\": \"electrical\"}"
